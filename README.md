Snez is a high-contrast non-realistic texture pack for Voxelibre, based on the LoSpec 500 palette, which you can find here: [LoSpec 500](https://lospec.com/palette-list/lospec500)

In general, the textures follow these conventions:
* No outlines on items.
* Hand-drawn textures. I've used noise filters in a few places, but the vast majority is done by hand.
* No color shifting for similar blocks (wood, stone, etc). This is done for maximum contrast and to make things easier for colorblind players.
** Note: Color-based tiles like wool and concrete do not fit this pattern, since they serve mainly aesthetic purposes.

PSDs folder contains working PSD files with various complex blocks.
Screenshots contains screenshots of the blocks in game. Please note that some of these were taken early on and may be subject to change as the pack develops.
